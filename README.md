# VPN Network Traffic Sampling Benchmark

This project provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) sampling techniques on network traffic data. It focuses on addressing class imbalance in VPN traffic datasets using samplers like SMOTE, WGAN-GP, CTGAN, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: A virtual environment (venv or conda)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/Sriram-ai-prog/VPN-Traffic-Sampling-Benchmark-)
   cd final_project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Experiments
The project is organized into three main split scenarios (60-40, 70-30, and 80-20). Each scenario has a set of notebooks implementing different sampling techniques.

Navigate to `notebooks/` and open any notebook in Jupyter Lab or VS Code to run the experiments.

## Core Package: `traffic_utils`
The `traffic_utils` directory is a local Python package that contains all the modularized logic. The notebooks automatically add the project root to `sys.path` to import these utilities.

## Dataset
The project uses `NetTrafficData.csv`, which should be placed in the `data/` directory.
